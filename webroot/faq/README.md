Web site FAQ

The `faq.md` file in this repository is loaded automatically by the URL at https://chia.net/faq/.

Faq translations are loaded by that URL if a markdown file exists in [locales](locales/) that matches the browser's primary language setting
or the manually selected languaeg.

In order to provide a translation of the faq, add the translated markdown file in `faq/locales` and name it `faq.[2 letter locale code].md`.
